          <h3>Your Privacy</h3>
          <p>I respect your privacy and don't collect a SINGLE thing, the Interstellar servers is the thing that MAY collect info, but good news for you. I have implemented
          more secure INTERIOR settings, your info will most likely not be logged, since I implemented these more secure features in the website, and have disabled some features
          automatically. I, this site, and any other site I made, is all based on the Interstellar servers, so I do not have any responsibility for what you do, the Interstellar servers do.
          By using this site you agree to this whole page/tab, ToS and Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h3>ToS of Interstellar servers</h3>
          <p>Section 1: Definitions, In this privacy policy, "We" refers to "Interstellar". "Personally-identifiable information" (PII) refers to
    information that can be used to identify a person such as IP addresses. "Official Interstellar deployments" refer to
    the Interstellar application running on the official server. "Interstellar deployment operator" refers to the
    person(s) running the Interstellar application. "ToS" refers to Terms of Service. Section 2: Summary, By using Interstellar, you agree you understand and acknowledge this privacy policy and its clauses.
     Interstellar will not be held liable in any situation that may occur as a result of using or hosting the
    Interstellar application on ANY Interstellar deployment.  The safest way to use Interstellar is by using its official deployments or by
    "https://docs.gointerstellar.app/windows-local" hosting Interstellar on your own machine. Section 2.1: Summary - Offical Interstellar Deployment : Official Interstellar deployments are run with privacy in mind. We do not intentionally collect and retain any PII such as IP addresses used to access the official Interstellar
      deployment. Section 2.2: Summary - Unofficial Interstellar Deployments:  Interstellar developers are commited to ensuring Interstellar remains as a secure application. However, we cannot
    guarantee the same level of security or privacy of unofficial Interstellar deployments.  The type of information collected on community deployments is completely dependent on who and where the deployment
    is being hosted. Generally, we recommend Interstellar deployment operators to collect as minimal information as possible. We cannot control unofficial Interstellar deployments. We cannot verify the authenticity of the code in unofficial Interstellar deployments. This is an extremely rare
    situation, but we will not be held responsible if your data such as an account becomes compromised as a result of
    malicious code in an unofficial Interstellar deployment. Section 3: Acceptable Use : Do not use any Interstellar deployment to do illegal activity. If you are under 18, do not use any Interstellar deployment to access any adult sites. Section 4: Third Parties : Section 4.1: Google Analytics Usage : Google Analytics is active and embedded in Interstellar's code. https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/. Conclusion statement added by ME, Information that may be unintentionally collected as part of using Interstellar's official deployment may include
    basic information such as your IP address, web traffic when using Interstellar, etc. This information is temporary
    and is kept until the server is rebooted. We do not purposefully collect anyone's information. We try to limit the data collected by the official Interstellar
    deployment. We do not, will not, and will never knowingly collect the information of minors under the age of 13 (or the minimum
    age required by laws in your country). We protect information stored on the official Interstellar deployment by limiting access. The only person that has
    access to the server of which the official Interstellar deployment runs on is the server host and the owner of
    Interstellar, xbubbo. Your IP address is used to allow you to use the Interstellar service. This is how it works for every website you
    visit, not just Interstellar. The difference is whether or not this data is intentionally collected and stored. Interstellar will NEVER sell your info to third-parties, other than to some ad companies. We do this so we can make
    enough money to pay for our server. The official Interstellar server operator may respond to legal requests and assist law enforcement officials in
    legal investigations if ever needed. We can't guarantee we'll always have information to hand out as the information
    that may be collected is automatically destroyed on reboot, but if we do still have information relevent to the
    investigation, we may provide law enforcement officials with it. Please redirect all requests regarding data with an
    unofficial Interstellar deployment to its operator, as we don't have control over unofficial deployments and
    couldn't comply with requests even if we wanted to. </p>
